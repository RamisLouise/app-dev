    This movie came from a well known game.The story begins with Geralt of Rivia, Crown Princess Cirilla of Cintra, and the quarter-elf sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg at different points in time, exploring formative events that shape their characters throughout the first season, before eventually merging into a single timeline.

  2. The Walking Dead:

The series features a large ensemble cast as survivors of a zombie apocalypse trying to stay alive under near-constant threat of attacks from zombies chiefly known as "walkers" by the other characters.

  The world of Alice in Borderland is an alternate version of Tokyo to which a bunch of seemingly normal citizens have been mysteriously transported to. In this new world, they must compete in violent and deadly games to extend their "visa," which is how long they have left to live.
